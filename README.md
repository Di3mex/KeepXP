KeepXP
======

This Plugin is designed to fit the theme of an ExtraHardMode server. The problem with exp and ExtraHardMode is that 
ExtraHardMode makes exp hard to get and if a player dies the exp is basically gone. This leads to players not feeling
like their efforts aren't being rewarded sufficientlly.

Therefore KeepXP adds the following two ingame items:
* Scroll Of Keeping
* Bottle o' Exp

Scroll Of Keeping
-----------------
* On death if the scroll is in your inventory the amount of exp dropped is greatly increased
* The scroll has different lvls [1-50%, 2-70%, 3-90%, 4-100%]
* The scroll is an one time use item and will be removed once you die

Bottle o' Exp
-------------
* Craftable Exp-Bottle that stores all your levels upon crafting
* Can be thrown on the ground like a normal exp bottle to regain the levels
* Crafting recipe takes a glass-bottle + an amount of one type
* The default recipes are 3 GoldBlocks + 1 GlassBottle & 6 LapisBlocks + 1 GlassBottle

Empty Bottle o' Exp
-------------------
* Non craftable Exp-Bottle that stores all your levels upon putting it in a crafting grid

Chest-Populator:
----------------
* All items found in KeepXP are added to DungeonChests amd StorageMinecarts
* This is the only way to obtain the uncraftable items
* Format of entries is "Material[count]: probability"
